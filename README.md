# Sentiment Analysis using RNNs with Keras

This project demonstrates how to perform sentiment analysis using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, in Keras. We utilize the IMDb movie reviews dataset provided by Keras, which is a popular benchmark dataset in natural language processing and sentiment analysis tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises 50,000 movie reviews from IMDb, labeled as positive or negative. We use the built-in IMDb dataset from Keras, limiting the vocabulary to the top 5,000 words for simplicity.
